## 🌟 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

> *"In a universe where the next generation of astronauts is sitting in classrooms right now, Jr_AstroCamp is our answer to the question every space agency asks: How do you turn a curious kid into a mission-ready thinker?"*

Most educational space software either reduces authentic space science to decorative cartoons with no genuine stakes, or buries young minds in dry, non-interactive encyclopedias.

**Jr_AstroCamp: Beyond Earth** transforms learning into a high-stakes, authentic aerospace expedition. Grounded in real NASA engineering data from the **Artemis program**, **Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)**, and **Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)**, cadets don't simply read about space—they **train**, **budget limited rocket cargo**, **command human life support systems**, **dodge lunar night power crises**, **drive scientific rovers**, and **experience the real chain-reaction consequences of every engineering trade-off.**

The project features a **unified dual-engine architecture**:
1. **Interactive Web Expedition Simulator (React 19 + TypeScript + Three.js + HTML5 Canvas):** A full turn-based planetary base builder, cargo allocator, rover simulation, and 8-lesson Astronaut Academy.
2. **Desktop 60 FPS Flight Simulator (Python 3 + Pygame-ce):** A high-performance flight physics engine with 76 cataloged historical NASA missions across 6 flight disciplines (Launch, Docking, Lunar Landing, Rover Traverse, Space Telescope, Deep Space Slingshot).

## 🎮 3. Complete Feature Tour

### 🎓 1. Astronaut Academy (8 Interactive ASCAN Modules)
A guided, interactive astronaut training sequence aligned with NASA human exploration protocols:
- **Module 1: Airlock & Depressurization Safety:** Atmospheric pressure differentials ($\Delta P$) and 100% O2 pre-breathe to prevent decompression sickness.
- **Module 2: ECLSS & Sabatier Reactions:** Carbon dioxide scrubbing and chemical catalytic reaction: $\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$.
- **Module 3: Power: Photovoltaics vs Fission:** Sun-tracking solar mast angles vs continuous 24/7 Kilopower nuclear Stirling generation during the 354-hour lunar night.
- **Module 4: Potable Water Recycling:** Vacuum distillation vs thermoelectric membrane loops recovering up to 98% of human moisture.
- **Module 5: Hydroponic Biomass & Nutrition:** Dual-spectrum 450nm/660nm LED salad pods, plant transpiration, and psychological crew benefits.
- **Module 6: Space Radiation & Regolith Shielding:** Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), Solar Particle Events (SPE), ALARA guidelines, and 1.5m sintered regolith storm vaults.
- **Module 7: Rover Traction & Terramechanics:** Regolith wheel-slip ratio, steering geometry, slope limits, and radar navigation.
- **Module 8: Cryogenic Core Sample Collection:** Raman spectroscopy and identifying sub-surface water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters (<40 K).

### 🚀 2. Mission Selection
- **Lunar Expedition (Shackleton Polar Base):** 30-Sol primary mission at the lunar South Pole. Features the extreme 354-hour lunar night and cryogenic cold traps.
- **Martian Outpost (Jezero Crater):** 40-Sol deep-space mission featuring atmospheric dust storm opacity ($\tau$), thin 610 Pa atmosphere, and longer telemetry communication delays.

### 🏗️ 3. Outpost Construction & Cargo Budget
Cadets are allocated a strict launch mass limit on the heavy-lift booster:
- **Lunar Mass Budget:** `45,000 kg` | **Mars Mass Budget:** `60,000 kg`
- Choose across 10 critical systems: Habitat, Power Generation, Energy Storage, Life Support, Water Recycling, Greenhouse, Radiation Shielding, Communications, Maintenance, and Surface Rover.
- **Real Trade-Offs:** Selecting heavy high-tech gear (e.g. Kilopower Reactor + Heavy Dome + Sabatier + Full Biome) exceeds the 45,000 kg rocket limit and **locks the launch button**, forcing cadets to balance mass vs capability.

### 🕹️ 4. Mission Control: Core Turn-Based Simulation
- **Authoritative Deterministic Physics:** Based on the NASA BVAD human metabolic baseline ($0.84\text{ kg O}_2$, $2.50\text{ kg H}_2\text{O}$ per crew-day).
- **Diurnal Day/Night Cycle:** Solar arrays generate 0 kW during the 354-hour lunar night (Sols 16–27). If batteries deplete to 0%, habitat heaters freeze, triggering critical failure.
- **Shift Directives:** *Standard Operations*, *Power Conservation* (cuts base electrical load by 40%), *Science Intensive* (+10 science yield at high power cost), *ECLSS Overhaul*, *Greenhouse Surge*, and *Rover EVA*.

### 📰 5. Mission Events & Branching Decisions
- Realistic, unscripted operational events: *Coronal Mass Ejections (CME)*, *Regolith Dust Abrasions*, *Water Recovery Membrane Leaks*, *Hydroponic Root Blight*, and *Cryogenic Ice Discoveries*.
- Comic storyboard panels illustrate the situation with multi-character dialogue (Cadet Maya, Commander Dadu, Houston CapCom).
- Each response option has explicit mathematical consequences on life-support reserves.

### 🚙 6. Playable Surface Rover Exploration (EVA Minigame)
- Top-down 2D canvas physics simulation with keyboard (`WASD`/Arrows) and mobile on-screen controls.
- Dynamic wheel tracks, crater terrain hazards, high-relief boulders, battery consumption, and a real-time radar waypoint compass pointing toward volatile ice hotspots.
- Drill core samples to collect Science Research Points and return safely to base before battery exhaustion.

### 🔬 7. Science Learning Hub & NASA Datasets
- 6 comprehensive domains documenting real NASA baseline datasets (BVAD, LOLA, Kilopower, CRaTER, REMS, NSSDC).
- Explicit `[REAL NASA DATA]` vs `[GAME SIMULATION VALUE]` labeling for complete scientific transparency.

### 📊 8. Mission Autopsy & Debrief
- Evaluates mission outcome (`VICTORY`, `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, or `CRITICAL_FAILURE`).
- **Explainable AI Root-Cause Tree:** Details the exact cascading chain of events that led to mission success or failure.
- Actionable NASA engineering recommendations for the cadet's next attempt.
